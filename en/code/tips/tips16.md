#### What is Continuous Approach?
A continuous improvement approach is an approach to continuously improve a project to make it better in the future. It is important to implement actions regularly, not just at the start or end of a milestone.

A typical action is to look back periodically and consider improvement measures to be the project in a better state. Yet, the concept and the best approach is vary depending on the perspective of implementation.

##### ①When to look: Past, Present, and Future
First of all, we look at things from three perspectives: "past," "present," and "future  in the continuous improvement approach.

In general, "looking back" means looking at the "past," but in the continuous improvement approach of Project Sprint, we think it is important to look not only at the "past" but also at the "present" and "future.

###### Why look at the present?
"The reason why we look at the present instead of just the past is because we believe that it is essential to share in real time how the project team members are feeling at the moment (whether they have any concerns or problems) in order to improve the team's situation.

If we only look back at the "past," there is a high possibility that problems are not be shared until after they have occurred, but by looking at the "present," we can share and address the problems before they become apparent or expand.

For this reason, Project Sprint recommends that we regularly share our current state of mind in the form of "[sharing of tension](https://projectsprint.org/ja/code/tips/tips10.html)" during regular meetings.

###### Why look at the "future"?
On the other hand, the reason why we look to the "future" for improvement is to improve the plan that we are trying to implement itself and to increase the accuracy of the plan.   

Although this is a risk management perspective, what is important is to share the hypothetical experience of "what would happen if we implement the plan we are envisioning”. If the plan is likely to fail, the plan can be improved in advance, and the quality of the plan itself can be improved. Even if there is no problem with the plan itself, once you have experienced it virtually, you will have more time to deal with it when you actually implement it.

"One approach to looking into the "future" and making improvements is called "premortem thinking. It is an approach that the project you are going to work on has failed. Then analyzes the factors that caused the failure and considers solutions. In business, the importance of "failing fast" is often pointed out. Premortem thinking is one of the most effective ways to experience failure quickly.

###### It is important to share the feelings of the present
While looking at the "past," "present," and "future" are all important in improving a project, we think it is especially important to share the feelings of the "present.
Having a place where people can let out their feelings will not only improve the issues of the project as mentioned above, but it will also improve the members' participation in the project (i.e., increase the quality of teaming).


##### ②What to look at: "Progress," "Process," and "Teaming
So, what exactly should we look at in terms of "past," "present," and "future"? As described in "[Principles of Project Sprint](https://projectsprint.org/ja/code/essentials.html),"
Project Sprint looks not only at the progress of the project (progress), but also at the way the project and meetings are conducted (process) and whether the team is in a good state (teaming) are important factors in advancing the project. Therefore, the continuous improvement approach also recommends verifying these factors.

When the above perspectives of "1) When to look" and "2) What to look for" are combined, the basic questions that can be assumed for each item become matters as shown in the table below.
This is the basic form, so let's define the necessary questions for each project, and then build a state in which the necessary verification and improvement can take place for that project.

 |Past |Present |Future
--|---|---|--
Progress|・Have we achieved our milestones? <br>・Have you been able to accumulate outputs that lead to the final outcome?     | ・Do you understand and accept what you need to output now?<br>・Do you have any worries or concerns about what you need to output?<br>  | ・Do you think you can achieve your goal?<br>・If you fail, what might be the cause?
Process | ・How did the project or meeting go?   |・Is there any discomfort in the way the project or meeting was conducted?    |  ・What will happen in the future if the current way of proceeding is continued?
Teaming  | ・Were the roles of the members clear?   |・Is there a sense of discomfort with the roles in the project?    |・What will happen in the future if the project continues in the current roles?
