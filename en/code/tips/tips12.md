As described [in Designing a meetings](../tutorial/section2-3.md), Project Sprint require meetings to be held regularly. Here, we will explain why.

1. Periodic review can help optimize the project.

   In highly uncertain projects, the path to achieving milestones does not proceed in an orderly fashion. In each phase of the project, there is an overlap between the start-up, planning, execution, and conclusion stages. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the project by reviewing the process in regular meetings, reconciling the perceptions of the members, and making adjustments as necessary.   

2. Periodic reviewing is able to catch up on the differences between the last meeting and the current meeting.

   Unlike routine work, a project has a high degree of uncertainty and changeable objectives. Even with the rapid changes in society or organizations, regular meetings ensure that each team member absorbs the experiences and changes. Therefore, each team member has a lot of input on the changes, which also allow them to agree on and change the goals or milestones of the project.

3. To reduce burden in rearranging team membersâ€™ schedules.  

   In these days, when many projects require the participation of various members inside and outside of the company, it takes a lot of time to adjust the schedule each time. For this reason, it is more efficient to set up a schedule in advance. Also, if meetings are adjusted each time, it is impossible to hold meetings at the necessary timing. This undermines the advantage of the Project Sprint, which is to gather enough participants at once to make decisions quickly and efficiently.

4. Holding meetings on the same day and time makes it easier for people from other teams to join the meeting for sharing.

    It is common to invite a specific guest to comment as a specialist on an agenda item. Yet, if the regular time and day are set in advance, there is no need to adjust each time. Therefore, it is more efficient to invite people at the already set time.

5. It is easier to classify tasks if the period is setting a limit

   By having a regular interval, such as "what can be done in a week," it becomes easier to predict how many tasks can be done. Creating realistic tasks will help to ensure that outputs are produced and to increase the accuracy of the agenda. Thus, by regularly repeating the process of reflecting the execution of individual tasks in the overall project results, the project will be optimized.

6. If you hold regular meetings, it is easier to create a rhythm of work, which makes it easier to finish your tasks.

   For example, you have a regular meeting every Monday. You can set aside time for the work. It makes it easier for each member to create a work plan.  

7. Regular meetings are a periodic record of the project.   

   Meeting agendas, minutes, and task progress reports are kept on a regular basis. This provides a log that is easy to refer to when looking back, and also ensures readability when new members join the project (because it is easier to understand the regular output according to milestones than to read past information unnecessarily). In addition, if a log is kept, it is easy to use it as a reference or template when starting another project, as this is how the past projects went.
