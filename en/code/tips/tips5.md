In Project Sprint, there is no set role that must be set except for the meeting role, and the only requirement is that the team members agree on the definition of the role.

However, the roles shown in the following table have been prepared in advance to be used frequently in practice.
In particular, if you are introducing Project Sprint for the first time, you can use these roles to make the introduction smoother.   

#### The Four Areas of Project Sprint And Their Each Roles   
The word "lead" used in each role has the connotation of leading the team to an ideal state. The role of the "lead" is to create an environment where the team as a whole can achieve what is required in each area and the metrics, rather than managing and promoting the project on their own. It does not necessarily mean that only managers or higher level people in the organization can take on this role.

#### Sprint Master
The Sprint Lead is the role that introduces Project Sprint. Specifically, the Sprint Lead is expected to explain the methodology described in the CODE of the Project Sprint to the team members and to actually lead the preparation and implementation of the Project Sprint.

#### Roles that lead each domain

##### Progress Lead
This role is responsible for leading the achievement of project goals and milestones. It is responsible for managing the progress of outcome and deliverable creation. It also considers effective and efficient optimization methods to achieve further progress and incorporate them into project activities.

##### Process Lead
This role is responsible for leading the maintenance and improvement of the correct functioning of the processes and the optimal operation of the meetings in each sprint of the project. Therefore, the process lead is the role that ensures the preparation and practice of meetings is effective and efficient.

##### Teaming Lead
This is the role that leads the team to improve the current state of the team. It is in charge of clarifying the roles of the team, coordinating when new roles arise or when there are changes to the role, and leading the formation of an autonomous and ideal team.
